# Offroad Jeep Game

A physics-based offroad simulation game built with Three.js and Cannon.es, featuring a Jeep Wrangler TJ tackling challenging terrain inspired by the Appalachian Mountains.

## Project Overview

This game aims to provide a realistic offroad driving experience with:
- Physics-based vehicle dynamics with realistic suspension
- Procedurally generated terrain
- Multiple camera views
- Winch mechanics for recovery
- Realistic sound effects

## Current Features

- Basic 3D scene setup with Three.js
- Physics integration using Cannon.es
- Vehicle controls with steering, acceleration, and braking
- Dynamic camera following
- Basic terrain generation

## Planned Features

- Enhanced terrain generation with rocks, water features
- Multiple camera modes (Regular, Wheel View, FPV, Back/Side View)
- Winch mechanics for vehicle recovery
- Sound effects (engine, tires, winch, collisions)
- Scoring system
- Multiple trails/levels
- UI elements (speedometer, score display)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/offroad-jeep-game.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npx parcel index.html
```

## Controls
