# Offroad Jeep Game

A physics-based offroad simulation game built with Three.js and Cannon.es, featuring a Jeep Wrangler TJ tackling challenging terrain inspired by the Appalachian Mountains.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- Basic 3D scene setup with Three.js
- Physics integration using Cannon.es
- Vehicle controls with steering, acceleration, and braking
- Dynamic camera system with multiple views
- Enhanced terrain generation with varied elevation
- Basic UI elements
- Multiple camera views (Third Person, Wheel View, FPV, Side View)

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Sound system
- Weather effects
- Damage system
- Replay system
- Achievements and statistics

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Features
- Winch mechanics
- Multiple trails/levels
- Scoring system
- Visual effects (particle systems)
- Vegetation system
